Description: Adds distinctive yet unobtrusive geometric patterns where solid 
    color fills are normally used. Patterned figures look just as 
    professional when viewed by colorblind readers or when printed in black 
    and white. The dozen included patterns are customizable in terms of scale,
    rotation, color, fill, line type, and line width. Compatible with the 
    'ggplot2' package as well as 'grid' graphics.
