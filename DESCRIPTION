Description: Provides geometric patterns to replace solid color fills in
    statistical graphics. These patterns ensure figures remain distinguishable
    when viewed by colorblind readers or when printed in black and white. The
    included patterns can be customized in terms of scale, rotation, color,
    fill, line type, and line width. Compatible with the 'ggplot2' package as
    well as 'grid' graphics.
